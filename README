Jitterbug : A continuous integration system built on Dancer and git hooks

Jitterbug is written in Perl 5 and depends on various CPAN modules, such
as Dancer, DBIx::Class and Git::Repository.

Installing Jitterbug
===================

perl Makefile.PL

# ... install missing dependencies with cpan or cpanm ...

# start the jitterbug Dancer app, which by default binds to port 3000
perl jitterbug.pl

# If you need to start it on a different port use -p
# perl jitterbug.pl -p 3001

In another terminal, deploy a DBIx::Class schema ( which is SQLite by default, 
change the values in config.yml to tweak) :

perl scripts/deploy_schema config.yml

Now add a post-receive hook to your github project that hits the /hook/ URL
on the server that the jitterbug Dancer app is running on, i.e.

    http://example.com:3001/hook/
